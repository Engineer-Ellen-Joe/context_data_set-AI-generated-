A: I think I’m going to quit coffee. I’ve been reading about cortisol levels and adrenal fatigue, and I’m pretty sure my morning latte is actually just a cup of liquid anxiety that I’m paying five dollars for.

B: You say this every three months. Usually right after you’ve had a double shot on an empty stomach and your hands start shaking like a leaf. You’ll switch to herbal tea for exactly two days, get a withdrawal headache that feels like a drill in your temple, and be back in line at Starbucks by Wednesday. Just accept your addiction. It’s the only thing fueling the economy.

A: But seriously, imagine waking up and just... having natural energy. Like, opening your eyes and feeling awake without needing a chemical jumpstart. That has to be a better way to live. I want to be one of those people who drinks hot water with lemon and does yoga at 6 AM.

B: Those people are lying to themselves. Or they are aliens. Look, life is hard. The world is on fire. If a bean juice gives you the serotonin boost required to open your email inbox without crying, take the win. Don't be a hero.

A: What are we doing for dinner? I am currently staring into the fridge and seeing a half-empty jar of salsa, two eggs, and a bag of spinach that looks like it’s melting.

B: I refuse to cook. I had a meeting that could have been an email, and then an email chain that should have been a meeting. My brain is mush. Let’s order Thai.

A: We ordered Thai two days ago. My bank account is looking at me with judgment. We have pasta in the cupboard. We could make a simple aglio e olio. It takes ten minutes.

B: Ten minutes of cooking, plus five minutes of prep, plus twenty minutes of cleaning up. That is thirty-five minutes of labor. I am willing to pay the delivery fee to buy back that thirty-five minutes of my life. It’s an investment in my sanity. Plus, I want spring rolls.

A: Fine. But you’re calling the restaurant. I can’t handle talking to a human being right now.

A: Have you noticed that we spend more time scrolling through Netflix looking for something to watch than actually watching anything? It’s been forty-five minutes. We’ve watched forty-five minutes of trailers.

B: It’s the paradox of choice. There’s too much content. Every time I hover over a title, I think, "Is this worthy of my remaining two hours of consciousness?" The pressure to maximize my leisure time paralyzes me. If I pick a bad movie, I feel like I’ve failed my evening.

A: Let’s just re-watch "The Office" for the tenth time.

B: Agreed. It’s safe. It’s familiar. It requires zero cognitive load. Put it on.

A: I ran into my ex today. At the grocery store. I was wearing sweatpants that I haven’t washed in a questionable amount of time, and I was holding a family-sized bag of Doritos.

B: Oh god. The nightmare scenario. Did they see you? Did you make eye contact?

A: Yes. We did the awkward "Is that you?" nod. He looked great, of course. Wearing a suit, buying, like, organic kale and salmon. I felt like a gremlin emerging from a cave. I tried to hide the Doritos behind my back, but the bag crinkled. It was so loud. The crinkle echoed through the produce section.

B: You have to move. It’s the only option. Burn the sweatpants, change your name, move to a different city.

A: I’m considering it. Why does the universe coordinate these things? If I looked amazing, I would never run into anyone. But the moment I look like a swamp creature, everyone I’ve ever known decides to go shopping.

A: Do you think we’re working too much? I mean, look at us. It’s Sunday night and I already have that pit in my stomach about Monday morning. The "Sunday Scaries." Is this just what adult life is until we retire at 65?

B: 65? That’s optimistic. We’re probably working until noon on the day of our funeral. But yes, the system is broken. We evolved to hunt for a few hours, gather some berries, and then sit around a fire telling stories. Now we sit under fluorescent lights for eight hours staring at spreadsheets that represent imaginary numbers. Our biology is not designed for the 40-hour work week.

A: Exactly. I feel like I’m constantly in a state of low-level "fight or flight," but there’s no tiger to fight. Just a passive-aggressive Slack message from my manager. I want to move to a cottage in the woods and grow tomatoes.

B: You would hate that. You panic when the Wi-Fi is slow. You’re not built for subsistence farming. You’re built for air conditioning and Uber Eats. We romanticize nature because we’re detached from it. If you actually had to chop wood to survive winter, you’d be begging for your spreadsheet back in three days.

A: Maybe. But there has to be a middle ground. Like, a four-day work week? Or just a society where our value isn’t determined by our productivity. I feel guilty when I rest. That’s sick, right? I feel guilty for just sitting on the couch doing nothing.

B: That’s the internalized capitalism talking. You’ve been programmed to believe that "time is money," so wasting time feels like losing money. You need to deprogram. Doing nothing is an art form. The Italians have a phrase for it: *Dolce far niente*. The sweetness of doing nothing. You need to practice that.

A: Can you look at this email before I send it? I feel like I’m using too many exclamation points. I don’t want to sound unprofessional, but I also don’t want to sound like a robot.

B: Let me see... Okay, you have an exclamation point after "Hi," one after "Thanks," and one after "Best." You look like you’re screaming with joy about a quarterly report. Tone it down. Change the "Thanks!" to a period.

A: But if I use a period, it sounds cold. "Thanks." It sounds like I’m mad. It sounds like "Thanks for nothing."

B: No, it sounds like "I am a competent adult doing a job." You don’t need to perform happiness. Just deliver the information. You’re overthinking the emotional subtext of a PDF attachment.

A: I hate modern communication. I miss letters. If I wrote this in cursive on parchment, the tone would be elegant regardless of the punctuation. Now I’m analyzing the pixel geometry of a smiley face emoji to make sure I’m not offending Dave in Accounting.

A: Why is it so hard to make friends as an adult? In college, you just sat next to someone in class and complained about the professor, and boom, best friends for four years. Now, scheduling a coffee date requires a frantic exchange of calendars and three cancellations.

B: Because everyone is exhausted. In college, your only job was to learn and socialize. Now, you have a job, bills, errands, relationships, and the crushing weight of existence. Friendship requires energy, and we are all running on 15% battery. Plus, the stakes feel higher. You don’t want to waste your free time on someone who turns out to be annoying.

A: True. I met a cool person at the gym the other day, and I wanted to ask for their number, but it felt like I was asking them out on a date. "Hey, do you want to grab a drink totally platonically and discuss our shared interests?" It felt desperate.

B: It is dating. Platonic dating is harder than romantic dating. In romance, there’s a script. In friendship, there’s no script. You just have to awkwardly hover until you bond over a mutual hatred of something. Shared enemies are the strongest foundation for adult friendship.

A: I bought a plant.

B: Oh no.

A: What? It’s a Fiddle Leaf Fig. It’s beautiful. It really ties the room together.

B: It’s going to be dead in two weeks. You are a serial plant killer. Remember the succulent? The cactus? You killed a cactus, A. A plant that thrives in the literal desert could not survive your apartment.

A: This time is different. I downloaded an app. It tells me exactly when to water it, how much sunlight it needs, everything. I named him. His name is Ferdinand.

B: Naming it just makes the funeral sadder. You’re going to over-water it because you want to feel like you’re nurturing something, and it’s going to get root rot and drop all its leaves in a dramatic protest against your love.

A: You are so cynical. Ferdinand and I are going to prove you wrong. We are going to thrive.

A: I think I need to delete Instagram. I just spent 20 minutes looking at photos of a girl I went to high school with. She’s in the Maldives. She looks perfect. Her breakfast looks perfect. Even her tan lines are aesthetic. Meanwhile, I am eating a stale bagel over the sink so I don’t get crumbs on the floor.

B: Social media is a highlight reel. You know that. She probably took 500 photos to get that one shot, she’s probably fighting with her boyfriend who is taking the picture, and she’s probably stressed about how much the trip costs. But you don’t see that. You just see the coconut and the blue water.

A: I know, logically. But emotionally, I feel like I’m failing at life. Why aren’t I in the Maldives? What did I do wrong?

B: Comparison is the thief of joy. Also, you have a job that doesn’t pay "Maldives money." You have "Jersey Shore money." And that’s okay. Just mute her stories. Curate your feed. Follow accounts that make you feel good, like dog rescues or satisfying pressure washing videos. Stop consuming content that makes you hate yourself.

A: "Satisfying pressure washing videos" is actually a great suggestion. It’s so soothing. Watching the grime just disappear... maybe that’s what I need. To pressure wash my brain.

A: It’s raining again. I swear it’s been raining for a week straight. I feel like a moss. I feel like I’m starting to photosynthesize.

B: I love it. It’s cozy. No obligation to go outside. You can wear a hoodie, read a book, listen to the drops hit the window. It’s the universe telling you to slow down.

A: It’s the universe telling me to develop a Vitamin D deficiency. I need sun. I am solar-powered. When the sky is grey, my soul is grey. I have zero motivation to do anything.

B: You just need a SAD lamp. Those bright light therapy things. Sit in front of it for 20 minutes and trick your hypothalamus into thinking you’re in the Caribbean.

A: I tried that. It just felt like I was being interrogated in a police station. It was too bright. I want real sun. I want to feel warmth on my skin, not radiation from a plastic box.

A: Did you hear that noise?

B: What noise?

A: That scratching sound. In the wall.

B: Don’t do this. I am trying to sleep. There is no scratching sound. It’s the wind. Or the pipes.

A: It sounded like claws. Tiny, sharp claws. What if we have mice? Or rats? Or a raccoon living in the drywall?

B: We live on the fourth floor. Raccoons are not rappelling up the side of the building to live in our wall. Go back to sleep.

A: *Scritch scritch scritch.* There! You heard that, right? That was definitely a biological entity.

B: Okay, fine. Maybe it’s a mouse. Tomorrow we will call the landlord. But right now, at 3 AM, there is nothing we can do. The mouse is living his life. Let him be. Just pretend he’s a very small, quiet neighbor.

A: I can’t sleep now. I’m imagining him chewing through the electrical wires and starting a fire. Or crawling into bed with us.

B: If you don’t stop talking, I am going to feed you to the mouse.

A: I tried to make that TikTok pasta. The one with the feta cheese and the cherry tomatoes.

B: And? How did it go?

A: It was... okay. It tasted like hot salty tomatoes. I don’t get the hype. I spent $15 on a block of feta and I feel whelmed. Not overwhelmed, not underwhelmed. Just whelmed.

B: Internet food is designed to look good, not taste good. It’s visual ASMR. The melting cheese, the bursting tomatoes—it looks great on a 6-inch screen. But culinary reality is different. You can’t hack cooking. Good food takes technique, balance, acid, heat. You can’t just throw things in a pan and expect a Michelin star because a teenager in Nebraska did it.

A: I feel betrayed. The comments section said it was "life-changing."

B: The comments section also thinks that putting butter in coffee is a personality trait. Never trust the algorithm with your dinner.

A: I think I need to start journaling. I have too many thoughts and nowhere to put them. My brain is like a browser with 100 tabs open.

B: That’s a good idea. Writing is thinking. Getting it out on paper helps you process it. Just don’t try to make it "good." It’s not a memoir. No one is going to read it. It can be messy.

A: That’s the problem. I buy a nice notebook, and the first page has to be perfect. My handwriting has to be neat. If I make a mistake, I want to rip the page out. I get performance anxiety for a diary that only I will see.

B: You are the definition of a perfectionist paralyzing yourself. Buy a cheap, ugly spiral notebook. The kind you had in middle school. Scribble in it. Draw ugly pictures. Make a mess. The point is the release, not the aesthetic. Stop performing for an imaginary audience.

A: You’re right. I’m going to write about how annoyed I am that you’re always right.

B: Make sure you spell my name correctly.
