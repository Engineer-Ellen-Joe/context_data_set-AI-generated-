A: I bought a juicer.

B: Oh no. Here we go. The "Wellness Era" has begun. How much was it?

A: That’s not important. What’s important is that I am going to be a glowing vessel of health. I bought kale, ginger, beets, carrots, and something called "wheatgrass" which just looks like lawn clippings. I’m going to drink my nutrients. I’m going to vibrate with energy.

B: You’re going to vibrate with frustration. Juicers are a nightmare to clean. You have to disassemble the entire machine to get the pulp out. It takes 20 minutes to make the juice and 40 minutes to clean the crime scene of vegetable fibers. You’ll use it three times, and then it will live in the cupboard next to the bread maker and the fondue set.

A: You have no faith in me. This time is different. I’m going to make a "Green Goddess" elixir right now.

B: Enjoy your liquid lawn. I’ll be over here eating solid food like a human being who enjoys chewing.

A: I think I have a cavity.

B: Did you go to the dentist?

A: No. I’m avoiding it. If I don’t acknowledge the dentist, the cavity doesn't exist. It’s Schrödinger’s Tooth.

B: That is the worst logic I have ever heard. A toothache doesn't care about quantum mechanics. It’s going to get worse, turn into a root canal, and cost you the equivalent of a used car. Just make the appointment.

A: But the dentist is so judgmental! They look at your gums and sigh. They ask, "Have you been flossing?" and you have to lie. I can’t handle the shame while someone has their hands in my mouth.

B: They know you’re lying. They always know. Just go pay the "I didn't floss" tax and get it fixed before your face swells up.

A: I’m going to write a novel.

B: What’s it about?

A: I don’t know yet. But I bought a Moleskine notebook and a very expensive pen. I’m going to sit in a coffee shop and look pensive. That’s half the battle, right?

B: That is 0% of the battle. The battle is actually writing words. You’re in love with the *idea* of being a writer—the aesthetic, the turtlenecks, the brooding. But are you ready to stare at a blank page for four hours and hate yourself? Because that’s the job.

A: I’ll just let the characters speak to me. It will flow naturally.

B: The characters aren't real, A. They don't speak. You have to invent them. You are the god of this imaginary world, and so far, your world is empty.

A: I tried to do that "Inbox Zero" thing today. I deleted everything. I unsubscribed. I organized into folders.

B: And? How does it feel?

A: Empty. Scary. I keep refreshing the page waiting for something to come in. I realized that having 5,000 unread emails was actually a security blanket. It made me feel popular, even if it was just spam from Old Navy. Now it’s just... white space.

B: You are addicted to the noise. You need to learn to sit with the silence. A clean inbox is a clean mind.

A: A clean mind is boring. I miss the chaos. I miss the panic of seeing "URGENT" in a subject line from three years ago.

A: Why do we have a "Junk Drawer"?

B: Every home requires a Junk Drawer. It is a law of physics. It’s where items go when they are too important to throw away but too useless to have a place.

A: I looked in ours. It contains: three rubber bands, a birthday candle, a battery that might be dead, a menu for a pizza place that closed in 2019, and a key. I don’t know what the key opens. It’s a mystery key.

B: Do not throw away the mystery key. The moment you throw it away, we will discover a locked box full of gold that requires exactly that key. Keep it. It is sacred junk.

A: I want to go camping.

B: You do not.

A: I do! Fresh air, sleeping under the stars, roasting marshmallows. It sounds romantic. We can disconnect from the grid.

B: Let me remind you of your relationship with bugs. You scream if a moth looks at you the wrong way. Camping is sleeping on the ground, surrounded by bugs, with no toilet, and no air conditioning. You will last exactly four hours before you demand to be taken to a Marriott.

A: But the gear looks so cool. The flannel shirts. The enamel mugs. I want the *vibe* of camping.

B: Then we can pitch a tent in the living room and put a nature documentary on the TV. You get the vibe, and I get a flushing toilet. Everyone wins.

A: I tried to parallel park today.

B: Oh god. Is the car okay? Is the city okay?

A: I panicked. There was a car behind me waiting. I felt their judgment burning into my rearview mirror. I just abandoned the spot and drove three blocks away to a parking garage. I paid $20 to avoid the pressure.

B: That is the "Social Anxiety Tax." Parallel parking is a performance art. You have to be confident. You have to back it up with swagger. If you hesitate, the other drivers smell fear.

A: I have no swagger. I have a sedan and poor spatial awareness. I am a danger to bumpers everywhere.

A: I’m thinking about getting bangs again.

B: No. We talked about this.

A: But—

B: No.

A: Fine.

A: Why is printer ink more expensive than human blood?

B: It’s a scam. It is the greatest racket in history. The printer costs $50, but the ink costs $80. And the printer lies. It says "Low Cyan" and refuses to print a black-and-white document. Why do you need blue to print text, Epson? Why?!

A: I feel like we should just go back to typewriters. Or stone tablets. At least a chisel doesn't need a driver update.

B: I support this. Sending a memo on a clay tablet carries much more weight. "Per my last email" carved into granite really gets the point across.

A: I watched a documentary about the ocean deeps. Did you know there are squids that are 40 feet long? And fish with headlights on their heads?

B: The ocean is terrifying. It is an alien planet right here on Earth. We know more about the surface of Mars than we do about the bottom of the Pacific.

A: Exactly. We’re looking for aliens in the sky, but they’re probably under the water judging us. I’m never swimming in the ocean again. If something brushes my leg, I will assume it is a Kraken.

B: That’s fair. If you can’t see the bottom, don’t go in. That’s my survival rule. The deep is for submarines and nightmares, not for recreational splashing.

A: I bought a lottery ticket.

B: That is a tax on people who are bad at math.

A: But imagine! What if we won? 500 million dollars. We could buy an island. We could buy a Senator. We could buy the company that makes the printer ink and lower the prices!

B: If we won, you would ruin your life. You’d buy a tiger. You’d invest in a "revolutionary" app that tracks squirrel migrations. You’d be broke in five years.

A: I would be a responsible billionaire. I would have a monocle and a top hat. I would be philanthropic.

B: You would lose the ticket before you even cashed it.

A: I’m going to learn French.

B: *Pourquoi?*

A: Because it’s the language of love. Ideally, I want to be able to order a croissant and sound like I belong in a cafe in Paris, not a tourist in Ohio.

B: You downloaded Duolingo, didn't you?

A: Yes. The owl is threatening me. He sends me emails saying, "It’s been 24 hours, do you want your family to stay safe?" It’s aggressive.

B: That owl is a warlord. But good luck. Let me know when you can say something other than "The cat is eating the pizza."

A: *Le chat mange la pizza.* See? I’m practically fluent.

A: Do you think our cat judges us?

B: Oh, absolutely. Look at him. He’s sitting on the highest shelf, looking down. He thinks we are hairless, clumsy giants who exist solely to open cans.

A: I feel like he knows my secrets. Sometimes I catch him staring at me when I’m dancing in my underwear, and his expression is just pure disgust.

B: He’s a cat. His default expression is disgust. He has resting disdain face. Don’t take it personally. He hates everyone equally.

A: I need a new hobby. Something tangible. Knitting?

B: You tried knitting. You made a scarf that looked like a tangled fishing net. It was three feet wide at one end and two inches wide at the other.

A: It was "avant-garde." It was a statement piece. Okay, what about pottery?

B: We discussed the mud. No.

A: Woodworking?

B: You with a saw? Absolutely not. I like having ten fingers.

A: Fine. I’ll just collect rocks. They’re free, they don’t need food, and I can’t accidentally maim myself with a rock.

B: Unless you drop it on your toe. Which you will.

A: I saw a photo of myself from 2012 today. The eyebrows... the horror.

B: It was a different time. We were all victims of fashion. I was wearing fedoras unironically. You were drawing your eyebrows on with a Sharpie. We survived.

A: But why didn't anyone stop us? Why didn't friends say, "Hey, you look like a surprised cartoon character"?

B: Because they looked like surprised cartoon characters too. It was mass hysteria. We all agreed to look terrible together. That is true friendship.

A: I’m craving something sweet, but also salty, but also crunchy.

B: Popcorn?

A: Too airy.

B: Pretzels dipped in Nutella?

A: Too messy.

B: This is the "Goldilocks Snacking" phase. You don’t want food; you want stimulation. You’re bored. Go drink water.

A: Stop trying to make water happen! I want a sensory experience! I want chocolate-covered potato chips!

B: That actually sounds good. Let’s go get some.

A: Really? You’re enabling me?

B: I’m weak. And now I want chocolate too. Put your shoes on.

A: I feel like the internet used to be fun. Remember when it was just funny cat videos and flash games? Now it’s just people shouting at each other and ads for things I talked about one time.

B: The "Dead Internet Theory." It’s all bots talking to bots to sell ads to other bots. We are just the bystanders caught in the crossfire.

A: I miss the purity of the hamster dance. I miss MySpace Tom. He was everyone’s friend. He never tried to sell me crypto. He just wore a white t-shirt and smiled.

B: Tom was the only good tech CEO. He took his money, bought a camera, and just takes pictures of landscapes now. He won the game. He escaped.

A: We should all aspire to be Tom.

A: I’m going to start waking up at 5 AM.

B: No, you’re not.

A: I am! The "5 AM Club." All the successful CEOs do it. They wake up, meditate, exercise, read the Wall Street Journal, and conquer the world before I’ve even hit snooze.

B: You are a night owl. Your brain doesn't even boot up until 10 AM. If you wake up at 5, you will just sit in the dark and be angry. You will be a zombie by 2 PM. Sleep is not the enemy. Biology is real. Stick to your schedule.

A: But think of the productivity! The quiet hours!

B: You will spend those quiet hours scrolling TikTok and regretting your life choices. Just sleep until 7. It’s respectable.

A: I bought a candle that smells like "Old Books."

B: Why?

A: Because I want my apartment to smell like a dusty library in Oxford. I want it to smell like leather and parchment and dark academia.

B: Does it actually smell like that?

A: ... It smells like vanilla and dirt. Mostly dirt.

B: So you paid $30 for a jar of scented dirt.

A: It’s *atmospheric* dirt.

A: Do you remember phone numbers?

B: I remember my childhood home phone number, my mom’s number, and the Pizza Hut from 1999. That’s it.

A: It’s weird, right? If I lost my contacts list, I would lose everyone. I wouldn’t be able to call you. I don’t know your number. You are just a name in the cloud.

B: That is scary. We should memorize emergency numbers.

A: Okay, tell me yours.

B: It’s... 555... wait. Is it 0234 or 0243? Oh god. I don’t know my own number.

A: We are doomed. If we go to jail, we are never making that one phone call.

A: I want to get a tattoo.

B: Of what?

A: Something meaningful. Maybe a quote. "Not all those who wander are lost."

B: Please don’t get a bumper sticker slogan permanently etched into your dermis. That is the "Live Laugh Love" of tattoos. Get something original. Get a picture of a toaster. Or a dinosaur on a skateboard.

A: A toaster? That’s your advice?

B: It’s timeless. Everyone likes toast. It’s a conversation starter. "Hey, nice toaster." "Thanks, I like carbs." Boom, instant connection.

A: You are banned from giving life advice.

A: I think my plant is moving.

B: Ferdinand?

A: Yes. Yesterday he was leaning left. Today he is leaning right. I think he’s tracking me.

B: He’s tracking the sun, A. It’s called phototropism. It’s what plants do. He is not a sentient spy.

A: I don’t know. He looks suspicious. I feel like he’s waiting for me to fall asleep so he can steal my breath.

B: He is a Fiddle Leaf Fig. The only thing he’s going to steal is your will to live when he inevitably drops a leaf for no reason.

A: Why is Sunday night so sad? The sun goes down and suddenly I feel the weight of the entire industrial revolution pressing on my chest.

B: It’s the transition. You’re mourning the freedom of the weekend and pre-grieving the labor of the week. It’s a weekly funeral for your leisure time.

A: We should abolish Mondays. Start the week on Tuesday.

B: Then Tuesday would just become Monday. The dread would shift. You can’t outrun the calendar.

A: I hate that you’re right. Can we just order pizza and pretend time doesn't exist?

B: Way ahead of you. Pepperoni or plain?

A: Pepperoni. With extra cheese. To fill the void.
